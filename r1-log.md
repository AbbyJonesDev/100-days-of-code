## Log

### R1D1 
Today's Progress: Got the Rails app for the server-side of HometownTourist running on my desktop. Cleaned up the repo a little bit and started working on the GraphQL queries for fetching posts.

Thoughts: I need to decide if I want to work slowly and try to do things well, or just keep moving and getting stuff done so I can get the project out there.  This is a side project and a good chance to get hands-on experience with different technologies.  It doesn't have to be perfect, but I don't want to build a mountain of technical debt that makes it painful to work on later either.
