### R1D1 
_January 1, 2019_

Today's Progress: Got the Rails app for the server-side of HometownTourist running on my desktop. Cleaned up the repo a little bit and started working on the GraphQL queries for fetching posts.

Thoughts: I need to decide if I want to work slowly and try to do things well, or just keep moving and getting stuff done so I can get the project out there.  This is a side project and a good chance to get hands-on experience with different technologies.  It doesn't have to be perfect, but I don't want to build a mountain of technical debt that makes it painful to work on later either.

### R1D2
_January 2, 2019_

No coding today, but I had a great conversation with a new developer looking for her first job in tech.  We ended up talking for a couple of hours.

_January 3, 2019_

No coding again today.  I'm really failing at this challenge so far.  But I got content from a friend for her website and started organizing it and brainstorming ways to set up the site.  I also installed the new Vue CLI and used it to spin up a project for my friend's site.
